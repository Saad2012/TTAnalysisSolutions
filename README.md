Here lies hugbubby's current work on the exercises of this nice textbook.

Submit a pull request if you wish to fix something, and I'll review it, but
otherwise this will just contain whatever exercises or problems I have finished
so far.

Note: Solutions not guaranteed to be correct, readable, or otherwise elegant.
I don't really care if you use this for your homework, one because you should
be getting graded by examination, and another because fuck college, but that
doesn't mean copying my work is a good idea.
