Here lies hugbubby's current work on the exercises of this nice textbook.

Submit a pull request if you wish to fix something, and I'll review it, but
otherwise this will just contain whatever exercises or problems I have
finished so far.

Note: Solutions not guaranteed to be correct, readable, or otherwise elegant.
Do not use this for your homework, one because you won't learn anything, but
two because you'd be a fool to think I've learned anything either.
